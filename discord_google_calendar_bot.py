"""
discord_google_calendar_bot

This is a Python program that integrates a Discord bot with the Google Calendar
API. The bot listens for scheduled events created in a Discord server, and
automatically creates corresponding events in a Google Calendar.

The program uses the following key components:

- Discord API client: Handles the connection to the Discord API and listens for
  scheduled event updates.
- Google Calendar API client: Interacts with the Google Calendar API to create,
  update, and delete calendar events.
- AWS Secrets Manager: Securely stores the necessary credentials and API keys
  for the Discord and Google Calendar APIs.

The program is designed to run as a persistent service, rather than a
short-lived AWS Lambda function. It should be deployed as a systemctl service
on a Linux machine, so that it starts automatically at boot time.

Usage:
    1. Set up the necessary AWS Secrets Manager secrets.
    2. Run the program on a Linux machine with the required dependencies
       installed.
    3. The bot will automatically connect to the Discord API and synchronize
       scheduled events with the Google Calendar.

Dependencies:
    - Python 3.7+
    - discord.py
    - google-api-python-client
    - google-auth
    - boto3
